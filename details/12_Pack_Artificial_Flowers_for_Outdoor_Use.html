They are easily cleaned and fade resistant. The color really pops! I could not be happier. They have a slight odor upon opening which dissipates quickly. No issues there.

However, they appear to be well made and are very lifelike. If it turns out that they easily fall apart, I will return and update my review.However, as things stand now, they appear to be well made.
