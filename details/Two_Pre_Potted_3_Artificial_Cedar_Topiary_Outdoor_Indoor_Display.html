All the branches needed to be pulled apart and bent into a natural shape. After taking a little time to start at the bottom and work my way up, I couldn\u2019t be happier with the result. The weighted base is enough to stabilize it while placing it in another container, but not large enough or heavy enough on its own to support or stop it from falling over in a brisk breeze. If you pull too hard on the branches, you may dislodge one, so be sure to work one branch at a time. It\u2019s easy enough to slide it back in place that way. The overall look is very realistic and I have already received several compliments as I was staging them on the porch. If they stand up to the Texas weather over the next couple months, will purchase more.","purchase_model":"Size: 3&#039; Color: Green*2  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2021-04-02 16:10:39"},{"user":"Alison C","content":"I received these today and could not be more pleased! They are so lifelike that my husband asked why I didn't wait to go to the nursery to pick them out until after he was home from work. He, of course, saw them AFTER me and my OCD nature spent a little while fluffing the branches (much like one would do with an artificial Christmas tree.) They come in small, sturdy little pots filled with a cement type material, giving them a very sturdy base... which has proven very handy since the wind was out of control tonight! The pots are small, so they can easily be placed in a larger pot as fits your style. They are sized as advertised, coming up to approximately my waist (I'm 5\"4\"). I cannot say enough good things about the overall serially and value of these little trees! Highly recommended!**The picture was taken while fluffing the branches and working on the shape, but you get the general idea!**","purchase_model":"Size: 3&#039; Color: Green*2  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2021-01-28 16:10:39"},{"user":"nvr2amzd","content":"I put these artificial trees in tall pots on my back deck.They look real and they look GOOD!And, I'm very happy with them!!","purchase_model":"Size: 3&#039; Color: Green*2  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-15 16:10:39"},{"user":"Brandi","content":"I live in an HOA townhouse. I had two cactus type plants in front of my door, and maybe b/c they were cactus is why I always forgot to water them? Anyways they started having dry dead leaves, and my nothing else to do HOA walks the neighborhood monthly to check that everything is up to their standards. So I get a mailing that says I will be FINED if I don't remove those cactus plants (which weren't really dead they just had brown leaves on them). SO ANNOYING!So I decided to just buy fake plants. I did a search on amazon for what was out there, and found some things I liked, but each one by itself cost more than these two plants combined. I read some of the 1 and 2 star reviews of how they look plastic and fake, but honestly I was willing to take the chance because first of all, I'm always in the house and I go in and out through the garage so I never even see the front door half the time, so who cares if they look fake or not, but I still wanted greenery at the front door.They arrived faster than expected and they did look plastic when I opened the box. BUT, when I took them out I decided to try to fluff them like you would a Christmas tree when you take it out. These leaves aren't bendable like a Christmas tree, but my idea worked. They came flat in the box, but as I fluffed them, they started to look a little more real. I put them into the pots that I had been using for the cactus, and voila they look good! Better than anticipated. I stood back away from my front door and you can't really tell they are fake. Nobody who comes to the door is gonna be inspecting the front door decorations so who cares if they really look truly real or fake up close? So for me, they are perfect and I'm very happy with them. And I can give a huge \"Screw you\" to my HOA when they next inspect the neighborhood!!","purchase_model":"Size: 3&#039; Color: Green*2  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-04-28 16:10:39"},{"user":"S.

They were well packaged for protection during shipping, only a couple of small pieces were loose in the bag and I just pushed each of those back onto the little stems on the tree trunk wherever one was missing.After gently spreading the branches evenly up and down each little tree, I potted them with real dirt to add authenticity.As you can see from the photos, they work well with the other plants and grasses, some of which are real and some aren't!They are also considerably less expensive than similar items at my local home decorating store.","purchase_model":"Size: 3&#039; Color: Green*2  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-03-28 16:10:39"},{"user":"HappyGal","content":"We use these little trees on our super windy porch outdoors. We like the size and weight of the tree's small pot which we planted inside our larger metal pot with dirt (where our real tree died). The little trees may not look all that authentic close up but they won't be inspected closely where located and they look cute & real at this distance. These faux trees are a lot easier & cheaper than constantly replacing living plants. Do we wish they were cheaper? Yes but compared to other small trees we looked we saw that these had a heavier base and a fuller look. The photos & description are accurate. For us this was a purchase we expect will last for several years or more, allowing to decorate for holiday & more so we are delighted.","purchase_model":"Size: 3&#039; Color: Green*2  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-10-26 16:10:39"},{"user":"Susan d.","content":"For an artificial plant I am pleased. I did slightly pull each lower brach at the insertion point to shape the plant.Only had about a 2\" piece of breakage in the total package.

I found large planters to put them in, added some rocks underneath them for weight and soil around them to make them look realistic. I think they look absolutely awesome on the front porch!Add a bit of leaf garland around them, pumpkin wreath on the door and a garden flag in front of them and voila you've got a full fall porch!These can be used anytime of year. In the winter time I will put red berry bushes (also artificial) around the edges of them, a string of lights on each, a red buffalo plaid wreath on the door along with a red and black buffalo plaid garden flag in the yard and turn them into a winter decoration!During the rest of the year I use white and black Buffalo plaid with them and they look absolutely awesome. Definitely recommend these faux plants because they go with absolutely everything, very versatile.Plus you don't have to water them!","purchase_model":"Size: 3&#039; Color: Green*2  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-09-03 16:10:39"},{"user":"Patti Spurgin","content":"They surround the patio beautifully!","purchase_model":"Size: 3&#039; Color: Green*2  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-06-26 16:10:39"}];
