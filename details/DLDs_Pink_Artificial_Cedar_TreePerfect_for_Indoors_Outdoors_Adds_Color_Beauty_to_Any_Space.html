THESE are NOT a disappointment!THESE are awesome!They are pretty much shaped out of the box.The are a bit \u201ccompacted\u201d from shipping, but letting them sit out for a day or so and \u201cpicking\u201d at them to make them look just right finished them off to a turn!After we got them in the perfect shape, we added a small USB powered fairy light string to each one and they are beautiful like trees that welcome guests to our door.We especially like having them on either side of the doorway with holidy decorations!They are like miniature Christmas trees!Especially lit up and covered in ornaments and tinsel.Ultimately, is it worth the price?YES!They are less expensive than some and look better than most!Do not hesitate to get these!","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-12-23 16:10:40"},{"user":"Christina","content":"These are nice for an outdoor space!These firs are weather resistant. They remind me of those plants that one can buy to decorate their fish tank with.But instead of a few inches tall, these are a few feet tall!And very bushy/fluffy!!And I am all for the bright Pink!!There is an attached planter base.This base is quite solid! And weighted!!Each tree has one on the bottom.And you might want to bring these in if it gets super windy out, but just typical breeze even a light wind- these will stay put for the most part. IIf the breeze is a little strong, it'll maybe move a few inches.You'll see what I mean if you purchase these for yourself!These are perfect for your little relaxation space!!","purchase_model":"Color: Pink Color: Pink  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-12-09 16:10:40"},{"user":"Kris","content":"As others have also reviewed, they took a long time to arrive but came very securely packaged (a HUGE box with a smaller box inside). They're totally squished when you first open the box (as you can see on the left in the photo), but with fluffing out, they look much better (I started fluffing the one on the right and will do even more). They look a little plastic-y in the kitchen light, but from far away, they look absolutely real, especially outside. The bases are also heavier than I expected, so I'm not very worried about them falling over with a pretty strong gust of wind. They're pretty true to size. Without a decorative plant pot (i.e., with just the basic, black, built-in base), the tips of the trees reach door handle height.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-11-16 16:10:40"},{"user":"mindylee","content":"I prefer real plants, including at Christmas time, but my kids wanted another more colorful modern small tree for the family room this year, and my daughter loves pink, so when I saw this I thought I would order it. Turns out it is a very pretty deep pink miniature faux decorative fir tree that is fairly full when fluffed after unboxing. A couple tiny tips of branches came off during unpacking and expansion, but they popped right back on, and the tree overall seems sturdy and looks great! It is really unique, and you could use it year-round as decor if you're into bright colors. My daughter will be going off to college in an other year and she likes it so much she is already planning to take it with her.","purchase_model":"Color: Pink Color: Pink  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-10-30 16:10:40"},{"user":"Dori Owen","content":"As you can see from my first photo, my two cats believe these two gorgeous trees are real! When I opened the box, and first saw these pink artificial cedar pine tree silk arborvitae faux potted plants, I was completely gobsmacked. They are a spectacular shade of pink, which happens to be my favorite color, and the quality is excellent. They arrived today, so I am still fluffing them out and arranging them how I want them, but I am over the moon at how they look and how well they are constructed. The pot that they are planted in is very sturdy and easily holds them upright. Further down the line, I may place them in a different container, but for right now I couldn\u2019t be any happier with every aspect of these faux evergreens. I HIGHLY recommend these faux trees!","purchase_model":"Color: Pink Color: Pink  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-11-10 16:10:40"},{"user":"Felicia Smith","content":"This set arrived ready to display after spreading your branches and takes little time to fluff up and they are absolutely beautiful!!!!These are very high quality and greatly Made!!!

It really is only 3 ft tall but appears to be smaller.The ad is quite confusing as it leads you to believe there are 2 trees but there is really only 1. The black pot that it comes in is plain and not shiny. I'm using mine indoors as my Christmas tree and I have a pink and white tree skirt to cover the boring black. It has glitter on it and feels quite sturdy.It would be perfect for Valentine's Day and just change up the ornaments. I have to say though it's not worth the $65 they're asking. With a lower price I would re-purchase it. It is nice enough to give as a gift.","purchase_model":"Color: Pink Color: Pink  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-11-09 16:10:40"},{"user":"M.

It's a in nondescript dark little pot.Now we are putting them in decorative pots and decorating the are. Not transplanting. They are firmly in those pots. Just putting in a cute pot.I grew up in a place with lots of real cypress so this gives me a look that makes me happy. The color and leaf detail is good. It doesn't look plastic.

Only one thing is you need to be careful when you flock out the branches because the pink pine leaves will fall and you will need to put it back again. For me that's a small price to pay for how good rhis tree looks like in person. It is plastic but a very good quality plastic. It holds ornaments very well and the pot is heavy. So there's not chance of you accidently knocking it off the bed side table. I got it for a little girls room and I have zero regrets expect i wish I got a taller one.Sizing it accurate.","purchase_model":"Color: Pink Color: Pink  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-11-17 16:10:40"},{"user":"Mermaid Mommy","content":"I love this set of faux trees!

The only con is that if you pull on the branches too hard while fluffing it, they will pop off.These are great and I am so happy I got them for my home!","purchase_model":"Color: Pink Color: Pink  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-11-30 16:10:40"}];
