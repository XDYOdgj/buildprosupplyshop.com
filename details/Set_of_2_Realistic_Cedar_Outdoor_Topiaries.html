It looks realistic enough and requires no water and no trimming. Not sure how it will do in the long term, but so far so good!","purchase_model":"Size: 5 Foot Color: Dark Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-05 16:10:38"},{"user":"M.M.","content":"I put these in urns on my front porch to complement my other Christmas decor outside.I think they\u2019re a good quality for the price and look pretty realistic to me.They have a heavy potted base pot which I buried in existing soil and I like that they came with extra life-like soil/branch pieces to put as a cover in the top of the plastic pot.They were packaged well. I spent a few minutes, starting at the base, to pull down each limb on each tree, to fluff out the tree more. Be careful not to pull too far down on each limb or it can expose the trunk/pole too much.Because of that, the tree necessarily needs to keep a more slender profile.If you have more time, you can then pull down or apart the smaller branches on each limb as desired to create a somewhat fuller effect\u2026.Bending some of these smaller branches down/sideways to cover some of the trunk pole also worked well for me.This took another 10 minutes and was a little tedious, but worth it. I only had a few tips fall off (other reviewers mentioned more), and they weren\u2019t noticeable.I\u2019m happy with these trees. I like the lighter color even though they\u2019re a bit lighter green than my existing decor /garlands in dark green.I like them so much I\u2019m planning to leave them up even after Christmas and through the winter until I can plant real flowers again in the spring.It\u2019ll be nice to have life-like greenery all through the winter in these otherwise empty urns !","purchase_model":"Size: 3 Foot Color: Yellow Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-12-07 16:10:38"},{"user":"Malaika","content":"I like the fullness of the tree and the strong weight of the plant.It can get very windy where I live and I don\u2019t have to worry about it blowing away","purchase_model":"Size: 4 Foot Color: Dark Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-13 16:10:38"},{"user":"Meagan","content":"\r\nThe media could not be loaded.\r\n","purchase_model":"Size: 3 Foot Color: Yellow Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-24 16:10:38"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"These trees come in full and looking very life like.","purchase_model":"Size: 4 Foot Color: Dark Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-03 16:10:38"},{"user":"Danny Drake","content":"Realistic and affordable!
